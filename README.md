The word collation is the collection and ordering of materials.This project defines a new methodology to sort and locate the material of a pre-demolition site to create a more reliable digital library (platform) of the resources available in old buildings. The purpose is to reduce the demolition waste generated by using the obsolete constructions as a mine for future buildings.

### WHAT IS OUR VISION?
Repurposing material in the construction sector is not something new. The churches were built using the materials of the roman forum and colosseum etc. In this case what we do in this project is embedding technology to a method that is being used for centuries.
